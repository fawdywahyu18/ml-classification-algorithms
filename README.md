Assignment 1 for COMP5318: Machine Learning and Data Mining. This repo implements multiple classification algorithms on a real dataset, covering data pre-processing, stratified 10-fold cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning with grid search. Algorithms include KNN, Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree, SVM, Bagging, AdaBoost, etc.
